# Computational-Physics-Homeworks-Year-3
A store of the computational physics related homeworks I have done as part of coursework (Python 3 Jupyter notebooks)

Homework Subjects:

Homework 1 - Investigation of Blackbody Spectrum Formulae (Rayleigh-Jeans Law, Planck's Law, Wien's Displacement Law, Stefan-Boltzmann Law)

Homework 2 - Investigation of Diffraction and Interference (Single-slit and Double-slit Patterns)

Homework 3 - Numerical Integration Techniques (Numerically Computing the Probability of Electron being in the Left Third of a Wall Given a Simplified Wavefunction

Homework 4 - Numerical Solutions to ODEs using a Fourth Order Runge-Kutte Solver (Solving Schr√∂dinger's Equation for an Electron in a Potential Well - Both Infinite and Finite Cases)

Homework 6 - Monte Carlo Methods (Modelling Radioactive Decay Chains)
